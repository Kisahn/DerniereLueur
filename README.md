# üïØÔ∏è Derni√®re Lueur ‚Äì 3D Contemplative Prototype

**Derni√®re Lueur** is a 3D contemplative prototype developed with Unreal Engine 4.26.2.

The player guides a small living lamp through a dystopian junkyard, solving environmental puzzles by manipulating light and colors via lens switching.  
The game emphasizes **atmosphere**, **exploration**, and **puzzle-solving** based on **light interactions**.

Originally conceptualized as part of the **MAJIC master's degree** (Universit√© C√¥te d'Azur), *Derni√®re Lueur* was presented at the **2022 Cannes International Games Festival (FIJ)** and received excellent feedback from the public.

## üì• Repository Requirements

This project uses **Git Large File Storage (Git LFS)** for managing heavy assets (audio files, 3D models, textures).

Before cloning or pulling the repository, make sure Git LFS is installed on your machine:

1. Install Git LFS:  
   https://git-lfs.github.com/

2. Initialize Git LFS on your system (only once):  
   git lfs install

3. Clone the repository normally:  
   git clone https://github.com/Kisahn/DerniereLueur.git

4. Pull the LFS files:  
   cd DerniereLueur  
   git lfs pull

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Without Git LFS, some project files (such as audio, 3D models, and textures) will be missing or corrupted.
